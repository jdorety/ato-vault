Non-traditional paths to development career.
Seeking and wandering

## Seeking

How to progress from competence into greatness.
Seeking is limited to what we already see

## Wandering

Undirected exploration.
Giving yourself the space to be bored and find the things that might have slipped through the cracks while seeking.
Wandering through media can also broaden horizons.

Finding a fun way to practice and learn can make it easy to get through the hard parts that can be a slog.

## Failure

Failure is an illusion.
~~Failure~~ Practice teaches resilience.

Seemingly unrelated experiences you've had can provide unique insights that can complement new skillsets.

**Put in work**
(but give yourself permission to relax)

**Stay Curious**
(but don't use wandering as an excuse to put off tasks)
