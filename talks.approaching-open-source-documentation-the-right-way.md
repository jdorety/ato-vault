Senior Software Engineer


Software engineers are some of the biggest users of documentation.
Software engineers don't usually enjoy writing documentation.

Documentation describes how to develop, deploy, enhance, and use a piece of technology.

Internal & External documentation

Product vs Process

Technical & Non-Technical

## What does "the right way" mean?

Documentation can potentially block adoption if it isn't _right_.

### Documentation as a product

Docs are a tool to drive adoption of a technology.

#### 1. Create user-centered documentation

Understand who the users are what are their needs.
What are they trying to accomplish?
How to surface info to help them accomplish what they want to do.

Break users down into user personas (e.g. customers, developers, contributors).

#### 2. Develop an Information Architecture

Focus on organizing, structuring, and labelling content in an effective and sustainable way.
Information needs to be **findable** and **understandable**.

#### 3. Define metrics for measurement


Ease of discovery

Ease of navigation

Information relevance

Assessment -> Design -> Implementation -> Review -> Deploy

Clean UI with clear CTA

API testing sandboxes (Swagger stuff I demo'd ðŸ˜ƒ)

Feedback mechanisms
* Make a PR
* Discord
* Thumbs-up / thumbs-down mechanism for relevance
* Requests for comment

#### 4. Automate documentation lifecycle

Design -> Implement -> Review -> Deploy -> repeat

Build in feedback opportunities for each stage of the cycle.

Manage documentation as an agile process.

Tools for easy versioning.

#### 5. Empower the community to contribute

- Contibution guides
- Community standards
- Docs style guide
- FAQs and help resources
- Dcumentation review process
