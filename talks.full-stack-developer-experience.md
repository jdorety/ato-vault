Grow your developer community by building an open and easy to use platform

## What it Developer Experience?

Assessing how external devs experience your products & solutions.

### API Experience

If your API is not consistent and predictable, it will provide a frustrating experience.

Measuring quality depends on technical and holistic guidelines.
Set priorities and a benchmark level for compliance.

Make other developers, departments, etc. aware of best practices and guidelines.

Get executive alignment and support/champions.

### Docs & Resources

Withouth docs & resources, users will not be successful.
Docs-as-code and self-service allows for superior scaling.

Training for allowing engineers to self-document (OpenAPI spec, for example).
Many tools to auto-generate docs, sdk's, etc. from OpenAPI specs.

**Docs-as-Code** = Pull Requests + GitHub Issues + CICD Pipelines

### Developer Advocacy

#### Evangelism

Building content for developers (blog posts, videos, workshops).
Training ambassadors to help spread the world.

#### Advocacy

Developer-Zero for products.

Listen to feedback from community and synthesize for platform engineers.
Organizational location isn't as critical as providing clear goals and metrics.
Able to help find issues before shipping.

### Community

Often treated as a support channel.
Encourage and reward peer-to-peer problem solving.
Include videos, how-tos, blogs, other content to deflect common questions.
Determine the best metrics to define success for _your_ community.
Engagement is not the catch-all metric.
Offer a variety of options to engage and participate.
