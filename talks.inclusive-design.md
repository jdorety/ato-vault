## Advancing Inclusivity Through Accessibility

### Inclusivity

All the design in the world can't account for poor implementation.

Inclusive design should be integrated from the beginning, instead of bolted on.

### Integrating accessibility into the work

User must be able to perceive the info being presented

UI forms, controls, nav are operable

User must be able to use UI

1. Know your audience
1. Understand how people navigate UI w/ different assistive tech
1. How do design decisions impact UX?
1. Adopt best practices for engineering and design to build accessible products

Accessibility should be part of every step of the dev process

### WCAG guiding principles

#### Percievable

Blind people need to use screen reader (gotta use the alt text).

Hard of hearing people would need captsions / transcripts for media

Blind person would need a descriptive audio description for video

Color blind person cannot rely on colors for error messaging (need clear written example).
They might also need links to be denoted by more than just color.

Ensure that forms and UI components can be reached by keyboard.

#### Navigable

Landmarks can help with navigation

Use properly structured, semantic headers

Use properly labelled inputs in forms to allow for alternative input methods (voice control, etc.)

Use simple and clear language. Aim for 5th-grade reading level to improve comprehension

Consistently style all commonly used elements

Clearly label required fields in forms

Be sure to include aria-alerts for dynamic / updating information on a page.
