Blockchain is more than Bitcoin.
It holds the promise to be a platform for trustworthy computing.

Supply-chain tracing. (We do have demo for this. Does it need updating?).

## Self-Sovereign Identity

You're in charge of your digital identity.
Decentralized identity can effectively vanquish honey pots.
Less tracking.
No unnecessary information (zero knowledge proof).

(He's using @BrianPlatz's example of proving you're eligible to drink in a bar)

## Permissionless Blockchain

Public keys are psuedo-anonymous.
