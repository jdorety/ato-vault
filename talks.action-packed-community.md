## Notes

Already in use at Fluree.

GitHub, more than just a place to store code.

Open source maintainers can easily get burnt out by success if they're working on their own.

Don't overwork. Set a certain amount of time, and then stick to that limit.

Don't maintain an open-source project on your own.

Reduce the number of incomprehensible issues with 'issue forms'.

Figure out how to get paid. GH Sponsors, open core model, seek out businesses to invest in you.
