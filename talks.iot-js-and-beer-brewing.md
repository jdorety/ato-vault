## IoT and JS

JS can be use anywhere!

FE, BE, DB, IoT

### Espruino

Wi-fi, USB enabled Microcontroller that allows use of JS via web-based IDE

### Raspberry Pi

You know it, you love it.

Libraries to check out `johnny-five`, `raspi-io`

### Which to use?

Espruino is great if you want to do one thing very well.

RPI is better if you need to do a lot of things

## Beer Brewing Basics

Ingredients
- water
- malted grains
- hops
  - balances out the sweetness of the malts with bitterness
- yeast

Prep the wort, then add the yeast.

ABV can be determined by determing the difference in sugar content before and after fermentation

## Sensors & Data

Ispindel - includes accelerometer and temp sensor

What kind of sensor data could I send to Fluree.

This has some good implications for supply-chain implementations.
- keeping track of ingredients and their condition across time

How can we use listeners to broadcast changes in data?

Charts! We need charts!
