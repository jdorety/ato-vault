## Working with Open Source Communities

### M.A.I.N.T.A.I.N.E.R.S.

#### M-A-I-N

**M**anualize - document your process and programs (trying to get a head start on this w/ JSON-LD)

**A**nnounce - review it with the community (set up beta docs site for upcoming JSON-LD documentation)

**I**nterview - get feedback from key members (talk with some of our key )

**N**ame - choose a name that means something to them

#### T-A-I-N

**T**ally - tally numbers from metrics that matter

**A**ggregate - tell a story from the data and numbers

**I**nvite - set up regular meetings and watering holes

**N**arrate - share the data and stories with them

#### E-R-S

**E**mpower - can they do great work and get what they need?

**R**aise - who can you recognize and spotlight?

**S**hare - your process, results, and wins with the public

### Q&A

Creating the initial documentation is often the most difficult part of the process.

Determining which metrics to pay attention to can be a challenge. Often, one can get a better idea by asking around in the broader community.

Interviews and feedback are great, but useless if the feedback never reaches the ears it's intended for.
